    <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>

    <p>
      The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century,
      <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There,
      he studied under another giant of mathematics, <strong>Jean
      Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics
      and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences.
      Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time,
      publishing over <em>800 different books and papers</em>. His
      influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.

      He is perhaps best known for his research into
      mathematical analysis. Euler's work,
      <cite>Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748)</cite>,
      remained a standard textbook in the field for
      well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau,
      he wrote
      <cite>Lettres &agrave; une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772)</cite>,
      giving a clear non-technical outline of the main
      physical theories of the time.

      One can hardly write a mathematical equation without
      copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such
      as e and &pi;, were introduced
      in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783,
      leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and
      certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.

    <h1>The Most Beautiful Equation in Math?</h1>

    Perhaps the most elegant equation in the history of math is:

    <code>cos(x)+isin(x)=e^xi </code>

    which demonstrates the relationship between algebra,
    complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this
    equation, it's easy to derive the identity:

    <code> e^&pi;i+1=0 </code>

    which relates the fundamental constants:
    0, 1, &pi;, e, and i in a single beautiful and
    elegant statement. A poll of readers
    conducted by The <cite>Mathematical Intelligencer</cite>
    magazine named Euler's Identity as the
    most beautiful theorem in the history of
    mathematics.
